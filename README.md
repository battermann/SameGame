# Same Game

An Implementation of the game "[Same Game](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame)" in F#.

The front end is made with [Suave](https://suave.io/). Very basic just to see something!

The application is [running on Azure](http://samegame.azurewebsites.net/) and is deployed directly from GitHub to Azure using Kudu and [Fake](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/).

For a nice introduction on how to set things up see [Deploying Azure web applications with FAKE](https://cockneycoder.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/deploying-web-applications-azure-with-fake/).
